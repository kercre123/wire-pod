# wire-pod

`wire-pod` is a fully-featured server stack for the Digital Dream Labs [Vector](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/pages/meet-vector) robot. It was created thanks to Digital Dream Labs' [open-sourced code](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs), and is primarily based on [chipper](https://github.com/digital-dream-labs/chipper).

It allows voice commands to work with any Vector 1.0 for no fee, including with regular production robots. Not just with OSKR/dev-unlocked robots.

## wire-pod vs. wire-prod-pod

This repository contains the original wire-pod, which is generally more dev-friendly and feature rich. If you want something more user-friendly and easy to setup/use, check out [wire-prod-pod](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-prod-pod).
